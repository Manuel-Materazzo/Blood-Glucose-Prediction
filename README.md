# Blood Glucose Prediction

## Problem Statement
Predicting **blood glucose fluctuations** is crucial for managing **type 1 diabetes**.\
Effective algorithms can alleviate some of the challenges faced by individuals with this condition.\
The primary goal of this project is to **forecast blood glucose levels** one hour ahead using the previous six hours of 
participant data collected using **T1D devices** and **smartwatches**.

## Dataset Description
The data used in this competition is part of a newly collected dataset of real-world data collected from young adults in the UK who have type 1 diabetes.\
All participants used continuous glucose monitors, and insulin pumps and were given a smartwatch as part of the study to collect activity data. 

The data was collected by the [Jean Golding Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/), the complete dataset will be published after the competition for research purposes.\
Some more details about the study can be found in [this blog post](https://jeangoldinginstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2024/08/19/how-smartwatches-could-help-people-with-type-1-diabetes/).

### Synthetic Dataset
The dataset used for the competition is private and its redistribution is prohibited.\
For demonstration purposes, a synthetic dataset mimicking the original data's structure and distributions is provided.\
You can find it at `resources/synthetic_dataset.csv`.
